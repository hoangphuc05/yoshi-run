<div class="bigger"> <h1>Project Design</h1> </div>

<p>This project is going to feature most prominently a website hosting a side scrolling game, and for our particular group we decided to do a Super Mario type game.  Instead of Mario though, the main character will be Yoshi.

The design will be as follows: </p>

<span> Essential Elements: </span>

<ul>
<li>Homepage</li>
<li>Links (via a menu) to other webpages like an about page and resources used to build the website</li>
<li>The game itself on its own page</li>
<li>Possibly a comments page where user feedback can be done </li>
</ul>

<p> The game will be for all intents and purposes will replicate Super Mario, with appropiate ability to run towards an end goal while jumping around, collecting coins, and defeating monsters. </p>

<span> Possible game description for the description/home page </span>
<p> Ever thought that Mario was overrated? Maybe too overrated?  Have you ever felt that Yoshi would make a better main character? </p>

<p> He can jump. He can kick goomba butt. He can run fast. Maybeâ€¦Yoshi is better than Mario!</p>

<p> Prove to the world that Yoshi is superior to Mario. </p>

<p>Instructions:
Left and right arrows to move, up arrow to jump. </p> 

<span> Images </span>

<p> Images for this project will be made using Photoshop and Illustrator and can be found in the game folder under the subfolder "images" </p>

<span> Collaboration </span>

<p>This project will be a collaborative one, and the website will steadily be improved (and look better) once new skills are learned.</p>
